Data Folder
---------------
This folder contains generated, downloaded, and sample data. The complete dataset was too large to include in this zip file and can be found on Google Drive: <insert Link>

The Google Drive folder contains the same information as what is in this zip file along with the larger data files.

The data folder contains a small subset of the data used to allow you to run the Jupyter Notebook in a relatively quick time to validate the results discussed in the report.

Code Folder
---------------
This contains the necessary scripts to download, combine, and clean the data. It also contains the Jupyter Notebook that runs the models and will produce visualizations. An exported copy of the notebook run against the entire dataset is also included.

A requirements.txt file is also included in this directory.
